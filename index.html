          The Royal Palace of Cambodia
          <span>(Khmer: ព្រះបរមរាជវាំង)</span> is a complex of buildings which
          serves as the official royal residence of the King of Cambodia. Its
          full name in Khmer is the Preah Barom Reacheaveang Chaktomuk Serey
          Mongkol <span>(Khmer: ព្រះបរមរាជវាំងចតុមុខសិរីមង្គល)</span>. The
          Cambodian monarchs have occupied it since it was built in the 1860s,
          with a period of absence when the country came into turmoil during and
          after the reign of the Khmer Rouge. The palace was constructed by King
          Norodom between 1866 and 1870; this original palace was largely
          demolished and rebuilt between 1912 and 1932, It is situated at the
          Western bank of the confluence of the Tonle Sap River and the Mekong
          River called Chaktomuk (an allusion to Brahma).

                    The establishment of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh in 1866
                    is a comparatively recent event in the history of the Khmer
                    and Cambodia. The seat of Khmer power in the region rested
                    in or near Angkor north of the Great Tonle Sap Lake from 802
                    AD until the early 15th century. After the Khmer court moved
                    from Angkor in the 15th century due to environmental
                    problems and ecological imbalance, it first settled in Phnom
                    Penh which back then named as Krong Chaktomuk Serei Mongkol
                    <span>(Khmer: ក្រុងចតុមុខសិរីមង្គល)</span> in 1434 (or 1446)
                    and stayed for some decades, but by 1494 had moved on to
                    Basan, and later Longvek and then Oudong. The capital did
                    not return to Phnom Penh until the 19th century and there is
                    no record or remnants of any Royal Palace in Phnom Penh
                    prior to the 19th century. In 1813, King Ang Chan
                    (1796–1834) constructed Banteay Kev (the 'Crystal Citadel')
                    on the site where the current Royal Palace stands . After
                    Ang Chan, the capital was at Oudong, about 40 kilometers to
                    the northwest, until in 1866 his nephew, King Norodom,
                    returned to Phnom Penh. Norodom lived first in a temporary
                    wooden Palace a bit north of Wat Ounalom, while the
                    permanent palace was being constructed. Norodom's palace was
                    a compound containing many separate buildings, of which the
                    most significant were the throne hall, the king's private
                    villas (there were two of these, one on the north side of
                    the throne hall and one on the south), the set of
                    traditional salas, or open-sided pavilions, known as the
                    Salle de Danse and Salle des Fetes (hall of dances and
                    banquet hall), and the Napoleon Pavilion. These were all in
                    the eastern, or public, courtyard. The western courtyard was
                    for the king's women, which the French called his harem, and
                    although this is not exactly accurate the only adult male
                    allowed to enter was the king himself. The whole complex was
                    surrounded by a wall (originally a wall to the east and a
                    moat to the west, but the moat was filled in some time after
                    1914) topped by decorative leaf shapes called seima; these
                    same symbols are seen on the walls surrounding monasteries,
                    and, as with monasteries, were used to symbolize that what
                    lay within is holy. In addition, just outside the palace but
                    part of it, were the Silver Pagoda to the south and the
                    cremation ground to the north, while the park on the eastern
                    side used for royal festivals such as the King's Birthday
                    and the annual boat races. King Norodom's palace was
                    demolished and rebuilt by his successor, his half-brother
                    King Sisowath, between 1912 and 1919, and today the only
                    sizeable remains are the eastern section of the wall and the
                    Napoleon Pavilion. The main elements of the public eastern
                    courtyard of the modern palace are:

                    The complex is divided by walls into four main compounds. On
                    the south side is the Silver Pagoda, to the north side is
                    the Khemarin Palace and the central compound contains the
                    Throne Hall and to the west is the private sector or the
                    Inner Court. The buildings of the palace were built
                    gradually over time, and some were dismantled and rebuilt as
                    late as the 1960s. Some older buildings date back to the
                    19th century.

                    The Royal Palace of Cambodia is a good example of Khmer
                    architecture featuring its layout of the defensive wall
                    (kampeng), throne hall (preah thineang), Temple of the
                    Emerald Buddha (Wat Preah Keo Morakot), stupas (chedei),
                    towering spires (prang prasat) and mural paintings. The
                    Royal Palace of Phnom Penh covers an area of 174,870 square
                    metres (1,882,300 sq ft) (402m x 435m).
